# Star Wars, the Command Line, and The Battle for the Fate of the Universe

Working in the command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. It's a big break from what you're used to, and practice makes (eventually) perfect. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line!

Please record your commands underneath each bullet point in this markdown.

As you work, make sure you git add . and git commit -m "[YOUR MESSAGE HERE]"!

## "A New Hope"
### Act I

* In your homework directory, create a new directory called `star_wars`.

> Example answer: `mkdir star_wars`

* In the `star_wars` folder, create two new directories: `empire` and `rebellion`.
> mkdir empire rebellion

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`.
> touch empire/darth_vader.txt

* Use the force (or your knowledge of the command line) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the `darth_vader` file. (Don't remember how to do this? Use the `other force`, known as Google!)
> echo "...heavy breathing..." >> empire/darth_vader.txt

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.
> touch empire/emperor_palpatine.txt

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a directory called `death_star`.
> mkdir empire/death_star

* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`.
> mv empire/darth_vader.txt empire/death_star/

### Act II

* Move into the `rebellion` directory.
> cd rebellion/

* Create a file called `princess_leia` and add the text "Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope."
> touch princess_leia.txt
> echo "Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope." >> princess_leia.txt

* Create a file called `obi_wan`.
> touch obi_wan

* Create a file called `luke_skywalker`.
> touch luke_skywalker

* Create a directory called `millenium_falcon`.
> mkdir millenium_falcon

* Inside the `millenium_falcon`, create two files: `han_solo` and `chewy`.
> touch millenium_falcon/han_solo millenium_falcon/chewy

* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi_wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`.
> mv luke_skywalker obi_wan princess_leia.txt millenium_falcon/

* Move the `millenium_falcon` into the `death_star`.
> mv -f millenium_falcon/ ../empire/death_star/

### Act III

* Unload the Millenium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millenium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory.
> mv empire/death_star/millenium_falcon/* empire/death_star/

* `darth_vader` has defeated `obi_wan`! Delete poor `obi_wan`.
> rm empire/death_star/obi_wan

* Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the `millenium_falcon`! Remember: `darth_vader` remains in the `death_star` and `emperor_palpatine` is still in the `empire`.
> cd empire/death_star/
> mv chewy princess_leia.txt han_solo luke_skywalker millenium_falcon/

* Move the `millenium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory.
> mv millenium_falcon/ ../../rebellion/

* `darth_vader` leaves the `death_star` to pursue Luke! Move him from the `death_star` into the `empire` directory!
> mv darth_vader.txt ../

* Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar's Canyon, Luke blew up the `death_star`! Remove it from the galaxy!
> cd ..
> rm -r death_star/
